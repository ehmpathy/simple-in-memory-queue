/**
 * creates a queue with a consumer which consumes each item one at a time with a remote calls, resiliently
 *
 * features
 * - is event driven: processes items one at a time as soon as they are queued, w/ a `maxConcurrency`
 * - is resilient: retries the items up to `retryThreshold` times in a row, removing it from queue after threshold exceeded
 *   - calls "onFailureAttempt" method when an item's failure count is below the `retryThreshold`
 *   - calls "onFailurePermanent" method when an item's failure count exceeds the `retryThreshold`
 * - is intelligent: pauses consuming items if more than `pauseThreshold` errors in a row on different items
 *   - calls "onPause" method when the `pauseThreshold` is exceeded
 * - is efficient: supports concurrency and non-blocking processing of items while others are delayed
 *   - allows consuming items in parallel
 *   - allows consumption of items while other items that have had a failure are delayed in the background
 *
 * usecases
 * - make calls against a remote api for each item
 *   - automatically retry items to recover from intermittent networking errors
 *   - intelligently pause processing if all items are failing
